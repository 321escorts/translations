## How 321escorts manages translations

To manage our translations we use GitHub. You might be familiar with GitHub as a programmer, or at the very least, some version control.

It can be overwhelming at first if you are not familiar with GitHub, however once you get used to it you will be surprised how you ever could live without it.

You also may check out the GitHub Guide [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com).


## Contribute

You can contribute in certain ways, and you don't even have to speak multiple languages:

- [Report any grammatical issues](https://github.com/321escorts/translations/issues) you may see or encounter any language, including English, on 321escorts.
- Submit improvements to existing translations by clicking on the pencil in the right hand corner of every yaml file.
- You favorite language is not present? Just create new folder with the proper [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), copying the contents of [main.yml](https://github.com/321escorts/translations/tree/main/locales/en/main.yml) and [seo.yml](https://github.com/321escorts/translations/tree/main/locales/en/seo.yml) into the new folder. You don't have to tranlsate every string, but please try to do as many as you can. Finally, submit the translations in a pull request.
